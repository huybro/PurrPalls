# Milestone 2
We have built a front-end that include login/signup page, index page for interacting with different profiles, profile page for editing personal information, and to-be designed message page.

## How to run
You will need to
 ```sh
  npm install 
  ```
and then run

 ```sh
  npm run milestone-02
  ```
which will then open http server on localhost:3000.

The profile page with mock data at http://localhost:3000/pages/profile.html
The login page at http://localhost:3000/pages/login.html
