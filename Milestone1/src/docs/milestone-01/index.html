        The web application "PurrPals" aims to revolutionize the way cats socialize and find companionship in the digital age. Our project addresses the real-world need for feline companionship, particularly for cats living in urban environments where outdoor exploration may be limited.<br>
PurrPals provides a platform for cat owners to create profiles for their pets, highlighting their personalities, preferences, and availability for playdates. Through intuitive search and matching algorithms, PurrPals helps cats find compatible friends based on factors such as age, breed, temperament, and location.<br>
Our target audience includes cat owners looking to enrich their pets' lives by fostering meaningful social interactions, as well as individuals interested in connecting with other feline enthusiasts in their community. By facilitating friendships between cats, PurrPals promotes mental stimulation, emotional well-being, and a sense of belonging for our beloved furry companions.<br>
